                <p>Jaunpur, a part of the Varanasi division of Uttar Pradesh, is known for its rich culture and historical significance. Well-known for its past and the glory of learning Jaunpur holds its own important historical, social and political status.
                        The glory of the city on the Adi Ganga Gomti and its peaceful shores was a major pious ground for the meditations and contemplations of sages, Rishis and Maharshis from where the sounds of the vedmantras emanated. 
                        In 14th century by Feroze Shah Tughlaq  named it Jaunpur in memory of his cousin Muhammad Bin Tughlaq, fondly known as Jauna Khan. Over the years, it was conquered and ruled by many regimes including the Sharqi dynasty and the Mughals.
