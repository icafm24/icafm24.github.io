    <div class="container" style="margin-left: 25px; text-align: justify; ">
        <p> In recent years, there has been an enormous interest towards the search of new advanced materials for enhancing the performance of various advanced technologies. 
            Interdisciplinary research is a key for future innovations in the era of modern times. In order to meet the rapidly changing technological advancements, this 
            “International Conference on Advancement in Functional Materials” (ICAFM-2024) has been taken as an initiative to serve as a forum on recent developments in the 
            ﬁeld of functional materials and related devices to promote interdisciplinary research in various areas across the world.
            The main objective of this conference is to provide an opportunity to scientists/researchers/academicians/ industrialists from various ﬁelds to exchange their ideas, 
            scientiﬁc thoughts and experimental results across various disciplines to explore the future global challenges in the emerging area of advanced functional materials. This conference will focus on many interesting and knowledge empowering scientiﬁc lectures of interdisciplinary nature, which will cover the frontier areas on materials based research, including materials physics and chemistry, soft materials, polymers and coating, nanoscience and engineering, bio engineering and health care.

    <h2 class="about-conference">About the Asian Polymer Association</h2>
        <div class="container" style="margin-left: 25px; text-align: justify; ">
            <p> Asian Polymer Association (APA) was founded in 2007 at the premises of Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India. The society involves academicians, scientists and technologists from all over the Asian countries providing a well knitted structure of the society. Vision of the society is to bring together Asian Science and Technology to the forefront of global arena so that a very dynamic association with the scientiﬁc world from Europe and America may be accomplished. The society platform will help out in bringing together the polymer community to a highly interactive association with each other. The society has grown as a dynamic platform at the international level with enormous collaboration with societies abroad.
